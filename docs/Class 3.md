## Pre drive inspection
✨ Every Time ✨
1. Walkaround
	- Check underneath, behind, in front, and in wheel wells
2. Check path of travel 
	- animals, people, obstructions, or objects that can puncture your tire
3. Check under vehicle for leaks
	- Water is fine, but other fluids are not
4. Visual check of tires
	1. Odd positioning, suspension, or alignment issues
	2. Also where tires are pointing
	3. Bulges, objects stuck in 
5. Damage to body, windows, mirrors, lights
	1. Windows are light, clean, free of snow or ice
	2. Check windshield wipers for damage

## Blind Spots
- Places you cannot see outside of your vehicle
- Created by structural columns
- Called A, B, C, D 
	- C = back right
- Beat blind spots by peeking around columns
- There are also blind spots formed by limitations of mirrors
	- Harder to check
- To avoid, do 3 point check
	1. Rearview mirror
	2. Appropriate side view mirror
	3. Out appropriate backdoor window
- Limits visibility, making it hard to stay positioned in the middle of your lane and hard to reverse the car
### Maintaining Lane Position 
- Rather than looking at pavement right in front of your car, focus your vision far ahead
- Focus where you look on where you want to go, you will naturally follow

### Reversing the Vehicle
- Blind zone behind vehicle is much longer than to the sides or front
- Look behind your shoulder
- Use backup cam when available
#### Backup Posture
- Hand on passenger seat
- One hand on wheel
- Looking directly backwards
- Can place left foot on dead pedal to assist in turning + to gain height in order to see
- For entire time vehicle is moving in reverse
- Only take quick, one second glances at mirrors/windshield to enhance understanding of my vehicle's position

- Danger zone of a vehicle is two seconds ahead & two seconds behind back bumper
## Getting in the car
1. Lock doors
	- Lock all vehicle doors first (for safety)
2. Parking Brake
	- Ensure it's engaged while vehicle is parked
	- Disengage parking brake to move vehicle
3. Adjust seat
	- Height: up/down
	- Position: forward/back
	- Seat back and headrest
4. Adjust wheel
	- Move lever on left side of steering column
	- Top of wheel should be level with shoulders
5. Seat belts
	- Put your seatbelt on every time you drive
	- Remind all passengers to buckle up
6. Adjust mirrors
	- Rearview should frame the back window
### Adjusting the side mirror
- **Left**
	- Back door handle reflected in left mirror
	- Adjustment depends on body style of vehicle
	- Proper mirror adjustment makes parking easier
- **Right**
	- Two door handles reflected in right mirror
	- Objects are closer than they appear
	- Convex mirrors give a wider but distorted view
